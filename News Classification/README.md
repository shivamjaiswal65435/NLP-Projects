# 📰 News Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning**. The model analyzes text features and predicts the category of a given news article.

## 🚀 Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models
- **Accuracy & Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
- **Real-time Prediction**: Input any news article and get the predicted category

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **news articles labeled by category** (e.g., Politics, Sports, Technology, Business, etc.).
- Preprocessed text is used for feature extraction and model training.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, NLTK
- **Machine Learning & NLP**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## 📊 Model Performance
| Model               | Accuracy  |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 85%      |
| Naïve Bayes        | 82%      |
| Random Forest      | 87%      |
| LSTM (Deep Learning) | 90%     |

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamjaiswal65435/news-classification.git
   cd news-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Predict category using a sample news article:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --text "Your news article here"
   ```

## 📌 Usage
- Train models with different algorithms and compare performance.
- Experiment with feature engineering techniques for better accuracy.
- Deploy as an API or web app for real-world usage.
